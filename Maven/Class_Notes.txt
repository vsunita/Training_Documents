	Continuous Development :
	
	Continuous Integration : 
	
	Continuous Delivery/Deployment :
	
	- Environments :::
	
		Non-Prod Environments						 ==>					Production Environments	
	
			- Dev Environments
			- Build Environments
			- Testing Environments
				- QA 
				- UAT 							===============>			Production Servers
		
	- Continuous Integration :	
		- It is a capability of Application Team to Continuously Integrate the Changes for further Testing and Implementations.
		
		- Automate :
			- Perform Application Build (Process of Compiling the Source Code & Create Artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec)
			- Unit Testing 
			- Promote the Changes to Testing Environments
			- Send Email Notifications to Concerned Team 	

		- Tools :			
			- IDEs - Intergrated Development Environments - Eclipse based IDEs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Intellj
			- Build Tools - Maven 
			- Unit Tools - Junit / TestNG				
			- Jenkins/Ansible/Docker/Kubernetes/Azure Pipelines/AWS CodePipelines


	Automate Application Build :::
	
		Application Build Tool :
		
		Java based web applications :
		
			- maven / gradle!
			
			- maven spring boot web application framework!
		
		
		Here, Maven is a build tool :
		
			- Using Maven, we can compile the source code, unit test the changes, create artifacts
			
			
	Maven Build Tool : 
	
		How to Perform Application Build, Unit Testing ?
		
			- Using Maven Build Tool 
				- Maven is Java Application Build Tool
				- Maven is used to Compile the Source Code 
				- Create Artifacts 
				- Perform Unit Testing (20 test cases)
					(Unit Testing is a process of testing the changes done by the developers)
				- Maven can verify the Code Coverage 		
	

		Application Build Process :
		
			Input 	: Source Code 	-	*.java  (github repositories)
			
			Output 	: Artifacts 	- 	*.war 	(Artifactory Libraries)
			
			

	Java Maven Web Application Project :
	
	Project Workspace - Folder :
	
	Java_Web_App_Project :::
						
		- src 
			main
				*.java 			# Business Logic
			test 
				*.java 			# 20 Test Case 
		- resources
			*.html 
			*.js 
			*.css 
		- application.properties 
		- pom.xml 
		- target	
			*.war  
				

		How Maven Works ??
		
		
		Application Source Code Repository :
		
			Developer create POM.XML File to perform Maven Build
							
	
		Maven Project :
		
			pom.xml - Project Object Model :
			
				- Will be part of the Java Application Project - Source Code Repository
				- It is used to define the properties of application artifacts 
				- It is used to define dependencies and the plugins required to perform build/unit-testing
	
			Maven Repository :		https://mvnrepository.com/
			
			<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit -->
			<dependency>
				<groupId>junit</groupId>
				<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
				<version>4.13.1</version>
				<scope>test</scope>
			</dependency>

				- Maven Repositories Contains the Maven Dependencies and Plugins 
				- During Build, Maven refer to this Repositories and Download the Dependencies to perform Application Build, Unit Testing etc...
				
				Eg.: 
				Build Environment (VM) :::

					Build the application	--> Jdk, Maven 
					
					Unit Testing - Junit Testing Tool 
	
			Maven Goals : 
				This defines the actions we perform using Maven 
			
				● mvn compile 	- to compile the source code
				● mvn test 		- to compile and execute junit test cases
				● mvn package 	- to compile, test and create artifacts in the target folder of Project Library
				● mvn clean 	- to clean the target folder.

				Eg.: 
				
				mvn clean package 	
				
				
				
				
		Java Web Application Project : - 

		My_Web_App - Folder 
		
		Maven Project Structure :::			# Java Maven Desktop/Console/terminal Application;

		MVN_Project1				# Project Name 
			src 
				main			# Maintain the source code *.java - Business Logic 
					*.java
				test			# Maintain the Test Cases and Test Data - JUnit 
					*.java
			target
				artifacts *.war / *.jar
			pom.xml 			==> defines the properties of application artifacts, plugins and all the required depedencies

			JRE_Libraries
			MVN_Libraries	


JaCoCo Plugin :::

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jacoco/jacoco-maven-plugin -->
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
	<artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>0.8.12</version>
</dependency>


		- Automate using Jenkins :
			- Perform Application Build (Process of Compiling the Source Code & Create Artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec)
			- Unit Testing 
			- Promote the Changes to Testing Environments
			- Send Email Notifications to Concerned Team 			
			
	- Jenkins is Build Orchestration Tool :
	
		- Used to Automate Application Builds and Deployments
		- To Create CI/CD Pipelines 
	

		
	Dev Environment :	
		Create Source Code & Push it to Github Repo.
		
		
		GitHub Server :	Github Repo
		
		
	Build Environment :
	
	
	Stages of CI/CD Pipeline:
	
		-> git clone 	===> SCM_Checkout
		
		-> Application Build using Maven 
		
		-> Unit Testing using Maven &  Junit 
		
		-> Create Artifacts using Maven 
		
		-> Promote the Application Artifacts to Target Environment => Ansible/SSH Plugins/Docker/Kubernetes
		
		-> Send Email Notifications to the Teams using Email Server 
		
		Target Environment : QA/UAT/Prod
