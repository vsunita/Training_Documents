			https://aws.amazon.com/console/
			
			
		Login to AWS Console ::::
			https://aws.amazon.com/console/
			- Login as a root user
				- email_id 				# Used during the registration
				- password 				# Created during the registration
				
				
		AWS Console is a Web Service to work with AWS Cloud Resources 
			https://aws.amazon.com/console/	
		
									
		Cloud Service Providers :					
			AWS/Azure/GCP/Digital Ocean/Oracle/IBM................		
			
			AWS Regions :
				==> Geo Location!			
				
			EC2 Service :
			
				==> Used to Create EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
				
				
			1. Create EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
					- Based on Linux OS Distribution
			
			2. Connect to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
			
			3. Login to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
					- Working with Linux Operating System
		

	1. Overview of Linux
		
		- Operating System : Is an interface between the User Applications and Underlying Hardware 
		
		Types of OS :
		
			- Windows 
			- Mac 
			- Linux 
			- Android
		
	2. Linux Features/Architecture :
		
	Linux Operating System 
		- Open-Source 
		- Is Secured 
		- Linux OS was created based on the Unix Operating System 
		- Is an interface between the user applications and underlying Hardware.
		- Linux OS is based on the Command User Interface
		- Core of Linux OS is called kernel!
			Components of Linux OS Architecture
				- Networking 
				- Storage 
				- IPC - Inter Process Communication
				- User Management 
				- Security Management 
				- Control Groups 
				- Namespace 
				- Process 	


		- Command Line Interface 
	
		3. Linux Distributions	
		
			- Flavors of Linux OS 
			
				- Centos / RHEL 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 
				- Fedora									

			Package Management - Package Managers :::
				- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
			
					- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
					- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
					- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
													yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
					
				- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
					
					- Package Manager - apt/yum/dnf ==> can Be executed as a root user.
					
					- TO work with Package Manager :
						- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
							- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
								
	Learn Linux on DevOps Perspectives :
	
		What the Role of DevOps Team/Engineer on Linux.
		
			- All the DevOps Tools can be installed and Managed in Linux Machines 
		
		What is your role here ????
		
			- Install all the DevOps Tools 
			- Package Management - Periodically Upgrade/Uninstall - Backup of the Tools
			- Managing Remote Servers 
				- Client Server Architecture 
				- Server1 (VM)
					- Client1,2,3,4,5,6
					
			- As a DevOps Team we can Manage the Linux Machines
			
				- Package Management 
				- File Management 
				- User Management 
				- Access Management 
				- Remote Servers Management 
				- Process Automation(Shell Scripting)								
					
	Working with Linux :::

		- Package Management :::

			- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
		
				- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
				- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
												yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
												
			- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
			
				- TO work with Package Manager :
					- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
						- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
		
			- To Install any tool/package :
			
				Install Pre-requisites	
				Install Actual Tool
				Post Installation Actions				
		
					Eg.: Tomcat WAS :::: 
					
						Install Pre-requisites			===> jdk 
						
						Install Actual Tool				===> Installed Tomcat 
						
						Post Installation Actions		===> Started Tomcat 
		
	Working with Linux :::
				
		1. Create EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
				- Based on Linux OS Distribution
				
				- Login to AWS Console 
				- Go to EC2 Instance Dashboard 
				- Launch EC2 Instances.
				
					- Parameters to Launch AWS EC2 Instances :
						- Name/Tag
						- Choose Ubuntu v22.04 AMI 
						- t2.micro Instance Type 
						- Key-Pair 
						- No. Of Resource  = 1
				
Next :
		
		2. Connect to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
		
		3. Login to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
				- Working with Linux Operating System

Day 4 : 14th July 2025
#######################					

		1. Create EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
				- Based on Linux OS Distribution
				
				- Login to AWS Console 
				- Go to EC2 Instance Dashboard 
				- Launch EC2 Instances.
				
					- Parameters to Launch AWS EC2 Instances :
						- Name/Tag
						- Choose Ubuntu v22.04 AMI 
						- t2.micro Instance Type 
						- Key-Pair 
						- No. Of Resource  = 1
						
		2. Connect to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)
		
			Perform SSH(Secure SHell) Connection to EC2 Instance :
			
				=> Host_Name 										# Public_IP_Address of EC2 Instance
				=> User_Name 										# ubuntu for Ubuntu Machine
				=> User Credentials	(Authentication Type)
						- Password based Authentication
						- Token Based Authentication
						- Key Based Authentication
							- SSH Keys: Private Keys & Public Keys
						- Passwordless Authentication
		
			- EC2 instance Connect Option 
			
			- SSH Agents (In Windows Machine) 
				- Putty/MobaXterm				Windows Users Install this in Local Machine
					==> https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html
		
			- Terminal ::
				- Command Prompt / Mac Terminal
				Eg.: 
						Open Command Prompt / Mac Terminal

						Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is aws2025-keypair1.pem

						Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
						chmod 400 "aws2025-keypair1.pem"

						Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
						ec2-65-0-183-132.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

						Example:

						ssh -i "aws2025-keypair1.pem" ubuntu@ec2-65-0-183-132.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com		

		
		3. Login to EC2 Instances (Virtual Machine)

			How to Install/Manage Packages ? :::
			
			- Elevate the Access to Root Level
				sudo -i 					# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
				
			- apt update 					# Used update the default packages
			
			- apt install openjdk-17-jre	# Install Java Package 

			- apt install openjdk-17-jre -y	# Tool

			- apt install git -y			# Tool
	
		
			- Linux Package can be a standalone Tool / Service 
		
		
				Eg.: 
					Tools 		: git,jdk,maven 
					
					Services 	: jenkins,nginx,tomcat,httpd		# Can be accessible thru web-browser
																	# It runs in its default Port_Number
					
			- Linux Application Service(nginx/Jenkins) 		
			
				- Start / Stop / Enable / disable / Status / restart 
				
				systemctl status nginx 
				
				systemctl start nginx
				
				systemctl stop nginx
				
				systemctl enable nginx		# Used to define the service as as start up service
		
				systemctl disable nginx		# Used to remove the service from the start-up task list
				
				systemctl restart nginx				

				- apt install git				# Install git 
				
				- apt remove git 				# Uninstall git 
				
				- apt upgrade git 				# Used to upgrade git
			
			
				Package :
				
					- Stand-alone Tool			Eg.: git
					- Service					Eg.: tomcat/nginx/jenkins/docker 
			
				which nginx						# Used to get the path of installation ?
				
				which git 
				
				git --version


	- File Management :::
	
			Navigate to Directories/Folders :::

				- pwd				# Get the Present Working Directory

				- cd				# Change Directory
				
				- cd <dir_name> 	# Change to a specific directory				
				
				- cd /				# This command will take to the root directory			
			
				- cd ~				# This command will take to the home directory(Default Directory) of the specific linux user
									Eg.: 	ubuntu 	===> /home/ubuntu 
		
									root	===> /root
									
				- cd .. 			# Back to previous directory
	
				- ls 				# Is to List the files and Directories 
				
				- ll				# Long List
