			- Open / Read / Delete / Update / Rename / Copy 
			
			
		File Operations :
		
			- echo "Message" 				# output statement - To print msg to terminal 
			
			- echo "Record1" > file1.txt 	# Create/update a file with record
		
			- echo "Record1" >> file1.txt 	# Add New Record to a file	
			
			- touch <file_name>				# To Create Empty file
			
			- cat <file_name>				# To read the file contents 
			
			- File Editors :
			
				- vi editor					# To Create/Open a file in interactive mode
				
				
				Eg.: 
				
					vi <file_name>			# To Create/Open a file in interactive mode
					
					
					vi sample.txt
					
					press :
					
						i 					# go to insert mode 	

						# Enter the file contents
						# Enter the file contents
						# Enter the file contents
						# Enter the file contents
					
						esc :wq				# Save and exit from file 
						
						esc :q!				# exit from file without saving the changes 
						
						
			- Rename a file/directory


						mv <existing_file_name> <New_file_Name>
						
						Eg.: 
						
						mv sample1.txt dummyfile1.txt
						
			- Delete/Remove files :
			
						rm <file_name>
						
						rm <file1_name> <file2_name>
						
						rm *.txt 
						
		Create Directories :
		
			mkdir <New_Dir_Name> 				# Make Directory 
			
			
		Copy files between the directories :
		
			cp <source_file> <Target_path>
			Eg.: 
			
			cp s1.txt /home/ubuntu/dir2
			cp /root/dir1/l1.txt /root/dir2
					
		Move files between the directories :
		
			mv <source_file> <Target_path>
			Eg.: 
			
			mv s2.txt /home/ubuntu/dir2
			mv /root/dir1/l1.txt /root/dir2


		ls 				# Get the list of files & Dirs 
		
		ls - a			# Get the list of all files & dirs(including hidden files and dirs)

		ll				# Long Listing 
			
			
		
	 File Access Management :::
	
		File Types :
		
			- Script 
			- Program 
			- Artifact 
			
			ll				# Long Listing 

			root@ip-172-31-3-180:~/dir1# ll
			total 16
			drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jul 15 15:13 ./
			drwx------ 7 root root 4096 Jul 15 15:04 ../
			-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5 Jul 15 15:05 s1.txt
			drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 15 15:05 sdir1/

		
		Owner 
		
		Group Users 
		
		Public Users 
		
		----------
		
		-									# Denote dir or file (Possible value:  d or - )
												'd'  Denotes Directory
												'-'  Denotes File 
												
												
		 ---								# Denote the Owner Level Access 
												Possible Values: r / w /x 
												r - Read only Access 
												w - Write Access 
												x - Execute Access 
		
			---								# Denote the Group Level Access
												Possible Values: r / w /x 
												r - Read only Access 
												w - Write Access 
												x - Execute Access

			   ---							# Denote the Public User Level Access
												Possible Values: r / w /x 
												r - Read only Access 
												w - Write Access 
												x - Execute Access


		https://chmod-calculator.com/
	
		chmod <Access_Level> <File/Directory_Name>
		
		chmod 600 s1.txt

		chmod 600 dir1
		
		As a best practise chmod 777 should not be used at any cause!
		
		
		
	- User Management 	:::
	
	
		Create Linux User :

		SSH Connection :	Secure SHell Connection 
		
			-> Host Name 
			-> User Name 
			-> User Authentication 


			-> Authentication Types :
			
				- Password Based Authentication
				
				- Key Based Authentication
					- Public Key 
					- Private Key 
					- authorized keys




		How to Create Linux User ?
		
			Username : devopsadmin 
			
			Bash Terminal Access :
			
			Home Dir :
			
			password :
			
			ssh-keys :



		Create Linux User with SSH Keys :::
		
			sudo -i 
			
			useradd devopsadmin -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/devopsadmin

			su - devopsadmin

			ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521					#ubuntu 22.04 or higher version of ubuntu				

			cd .ssh
			
			ls ~/.ssh 

			#You should see following two files:

			#id_ecdsa - private key
			#id_ecdsa.pub - public
			
			
			cat id_ecdsa.pub > authorized_keys			# authorized_keys this file name should be same.
			
			authorized_keys :::
				It is the copy of Public Key.
				
				Always the private key will be compared with the authorized_keys
				
			chmod 600 /home/devopsadmin/.ssh/*					# Used to Change the Access Mode of Files or Directories
			
			chown -R devopsadmin:devopsadmin /opt/tomcat/		# Used to Change the Ownership of Files or Directories
			
			
		Get the List of Linux Users ::::
			cat /etc/passwd
		
		Get the list of Linux User Groups :::: 
			cat /etc/group
	
		Create Password to any Linux User:
		
			As a root user ::
			
				passwd <user_name>
				
		root@ip-172-31-46-175:~# passwd devopsadmin
		New password:
		Retype new password:
		passwd: password updated successfully
		
				passwd -d <user_name>		# Delete Linux User Password
