	Installation of Kubernetes using Kubeadm :::	
	
		1. Launch 3 VMs on AWS Cloud (Ubuntu v22.04) --> (1 Master Node, 2 WorkerNodes)
		
		In all the Nodes(i.e., Master Node and WorkerNodes):
		
			2. Allow all traffic for all the nodes - just for this demo
			3. Change the HostName of all the Nodes
			4. Disable swap configuration in all the nodes
			5. Install Docker in all the nodes
			6. Install CRI - 'Container-D' in all the nodes
			7. Install Kubeadm,kubelet,kubectl 
			8. Enable Kubelet	
		   
		Only on Master Node:
		
			9. Execute Kubeadm Init Command 		# To initialize Kubernetes Master Node
			10. Enable user Access to Kubernetes
			11. Install flannel Network plugins for kubeproxy

		Only on WorkerNodes:		
		
			12. Execute Kubeadm Join Command 		# To attach the Worknodes with Kubernetes Master Node.

		Deployment 


	ReplicaSet :::
	
		--> Replicaset is used to execute the specific no. of pods in the cluster.
		--> Replicaset uses the Set Based Operator
		--> Used to replicate the pods and able to scale up/down
		--> The Replicasets will be automatically created, while creating Deployment Controller Object.
	
	Deployment Controller Object :::
	
		--> It is used to deploy the pods and ensure high availability of pods by creating pod replicas 
		--> 1. Create Muliple instance/replicas/copies of pods 
			2. Used to Scale-Up / Scale-Down the Pods 
			3. Used to Upgrade the application pods 
			4. Used to Down-grade/roll-back the application pods
		--> The upgrade/down-grade of application pods can be done without any downtime. 
		--> To achieve zero-downtime during upgrade/down-grade, By Default, it used Rolling-Update Deployment Strategy.
