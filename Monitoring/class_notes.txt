	Continuous Monitoring using Prometheus/Grafana :::
	
	
	- Production Monitoring Team & Production Support Team :
	
	
	- Continuous Monitoring :::	
	
		- Is it ensure High Availability of Production Environments.
		- To Ensure Buniness Continuity
		
			- Infra-Structure Monitoring :::
				
				- Tools : Prometheus/Grafana/Dynatrace/Splunk/Nagios
				
					-> CPU Utilization 		--> Threshold Limit ==> 75%
											--> Alert/Notifications based on Threshold limit

					-> Memory Utilization 	--> Threshold Limit ==> 75%
											--> Alert/Notifications based on Threshold limit
		
			- Application Monitoring :
			
				- Tools : AppDynamics/DataDog 	
				
				
				
	- Prometheus/Grafana :::
		
		- Prometheus 	::	==> Is a Monitoring Tool.
								Is used to Monitoring the Infra-Structure
							
							
		- Grafana 		:: 	==> Is a Visualization Tool.
								Is used to Create Monitoring Dashboards based on the Monitoring Metrics from Monitoring Tools like Prometheus.
		

		- Architecture of Monitoring Tools/Services
		
		- Architecture Components
		
			- Monitoring Server 
			- Target Nodes 
			- Monitoring Agent - Node Exporter
			- Retrieval Component used to Pull the metrics from Target Service using Monitoring Agents
			- Time Series Database 
	
	
	
	- Managed Services :
	
		- AWS			 ==> Cloud watch 
		- Azure 		 ==> Azure Monitor
		- GCP 			 ==> G Montior		
		
	- Working with Prometheus & Grafana ::
	
		- Install and Config Prometheus & Grafana.
		
		
		- PromQL 	==> Query Language.
		
		
	
Next :::
	
	- Kubernetes ::::	
	
		- Helm Package Manager for Kubernetes Cluster.
		
			- Using Helm we can setup Prometheus & Grafana to Monitor Kubernetes Cluster.
			
			- Helm can be install in only on Kubernetes Master.
